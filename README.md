##  Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- MongoDB database (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- Cloudinary account for image uploads
- Git for version control

##  Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd qmc-cms-website
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key

# Cloudinary
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### 4. Database Setup
The application will automatically create the necessary collections when you first run it. However, you'll need to create an admin user manually.

### 5. Create Admin User
Connect to your MongoDB database and create an admin user:

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or MongoDB Compass
db.users.insertOne({
  email: "admin@qmc.edu.ng",
  password: "$2a$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCOYz6TtxMQJqhN8/LewdBPj/VcSforHgO", // hashed "admin123"
  name: "QMC Administrator",
  role: "admin",
  createdAt: new Date()
})
```

### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the public website and `http://localhost:3000/admin` for the admin dashboard.

##  Admin Access
